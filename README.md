# MLINT
Tutorial material for MLINT. We explore the ideas of uncovering dynamical regimes and theoretical discovery using machine learning, using both synthetic data, and data from Sonnewald et al. 2019 & 2021. The material is in the shape of a `binder', so no installation is necessary to execute and play with the code. Simply click the button:

The ``notebook'' uses the python programming language. The different bits are organized into cells that can be executed using shift+enter
The hope here is to provide both some basic rationales and code with which to start off any exploration, and I use a mix of real and synthetic toy data towards this.
